As a logged-in user, I want to receive a "no effort" random movie recommendation. I will be sent to the main page where all the input options are located. 
If I click "Recommend a Movie," without specifying any other inputs, the website should automatically give a movie recommendation based on the weather. 
The weather determines which genre of movie will be displayed. For example, if it is rainy, a random movie in the drama genre will be selected. 
The website will display the movie poster, movie name, genre, and year. I can then filter this movie by placing it in a folder or designating it as "Watched" 
(see user story 4).
