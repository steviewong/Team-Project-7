As a logged-in user, I want to receive a "no effort" random movie recommendation based on the weather. From the main page, I will click on "Weather,"
at which point the website should automatically give a movie recommendation based on the weather. If for some reason a movie is not displayed, I can click the home
button to return to the home page without logging out of the website. The website will display the movie poster, movie name, genre, and year. 
The page also displays the key weather facts that determined the movie such as "Cloudy." If I am not satisified with my specific recommendation, I can click the 
"Weather" button again to receive another recommendation. If the "Sunny" appears in the weather condition, a movie in one of the following genres will be recommended:
action, comedy, drama, fantasy, and romance. If "Rain" appears in the weather condition AND the temperature is warmer than 60 degrees, a movie in one of the following 
genres will be recommended: comedy, drama, fantasy, mystery, and science fiction. If "Rain" appears in the weather condition AND the temperature is colder than 60
degrees, a movie in one of the following genres will be recommended: drama, horror, mystery, science fiction, and thriller. If "Snow" appears in the weather condition, 
a movie in one of the following genres will be recommended: fantasy, mystery, and romance. If "Cloudy" appears in the weather condition, a movie in one of the following
genres will be recommended: action, drama, mystery, science fiction, and thriller. If "Storm" appears in the weather condition, a movie from one of the following genres 
will be recommended: action, drama, horror, mystery, and thriller. If none of those conditions are met, a movie from a random genre will be displayed.
