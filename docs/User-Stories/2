As a logged-in user, I want to receive a "no effort" random movie recommendation based on the weather. From the main page, I will click on "Weather,"
at which point the website should automatically give a movie recommendation based on the weather. If for some reason a movie is not displayed, I can click the home
button to return to the home page without logging out of the website. The weather determines which genre of movie will be displayed. 
For example, if it is rainy, a random movie in the drama genre may be selected. The website will display the movie poster, movie name, genre, and year. 
I can then filter this movie by placing it in a folder or designating it as "Watched" (see user story 4). Additionally, the page also displays the key weather facts. 
For example, "It is 48 degrees and cloudy in Boston, MA, so I recommend dramas." If I am not satisified with my specific recommendation, I can click the "Recommend another
movie" button to receive another recommendation.
