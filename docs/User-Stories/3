As a logged-in user, I should be taken to the main page where I can either be recommended a random movie based on the weather or based on a specified genre. 
If I click on the "Filter by genre" button, I will be taken to the appropriate page in which I am recommended a movie based on the genre specified, not the weather.
I can specify the genre through a dropdown menu containing all accepted genres. The genres include: action, comedy, drama, fantasy, horror, mystery, romance,
science fiction, thriller, and Christmas. Once I choose a genre and hit search, I will receive a recommendation. This will include the movie poster, title, and 
description
