As a logged-in user, I should be taken to the main page where I can either be recommended a random movie based on the weather or customer filters. 
If I click on the "Custom filters" button, I will be taken to the appropriate page in which I am recommended a movie based on my filters, not the weather.
These custom filters include: rating, runtime and genre. I should then be able to type in the specific runtime, which if it is not in an accepted format will give 
an error message. Runtimes +/- 20 minutes of the specified runtime will be accepted. Additionally, I can specify the genre through a dropdown menu containing all 
accepted genres. I can also specify the desired rating through a dropdown menu with the following ratings: <1, 1-1.5, 1.5-2, 2-2.5, 2.5-3, 3-3.5, 3.5-4, 4-4.5, 4.5+. 
Once I am satsified with my inputs, I will click the search button and a random movie that meets my constraints will be displayed.
