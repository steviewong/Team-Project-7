As a logged-in user, I want to be able to share movies that I like or dislike with my friends in order to discuss the movies. After using the search 
function to find movies, I want to be able to click on the movie I am interested in and find a clearly marked share button. When I click on the share 
button, I want to be able to share to a social media platform like Facebook. If I click on the share button and something goes wrong, such as the buttons to share it 
doesn't work, I want to be able to go back to where the movie information appeared. I want the generated link to bring the person it is shared with to the same page with the movie description I am looking at when I 
send the link, so that we can discuss the movie and they know the same information about it that I do.
