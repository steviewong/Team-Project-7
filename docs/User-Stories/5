As a logged-in user, I want to be able to share the website with other people through email. There will be an email icon that once clicked should automatically
direct you to your mail app in your computer and pre fill your subject line and body with text and the url to the main website. All I would need to do is type in 
the email of the person who I would want to send it to.
